[A Second Look at the W600-PICO Development Board](https://sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/w600/second_look_w600_en.html).

**This repository is meant to replace the older [w600_micropython_examples](https://github.com/sigmdel/w600_micropython_examples) repository which used MicroPython version 1.10 
that comes preinstalled on the board.**

For detailed instructions on how to update firmware of the W600-PICO see [4. Flashing the MicroPython Firmware](https://sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/w600/second_look_w600_en.html#flash_um).
